# ReqSpecOnto
Software Requirements Specification Ontology by Usman Ahmed (usmanahmed@dreamxoft.com)
For the purpose of research in web semantics & software requirements specification.
This Ontology was an effort to create unambiguous software requirements specification.
Upper Ontology (classes, sub-classes, object properties, etc) part is the generic ontology for requirements specification of any software system while Derived Ontology (individuals) part in this ontology refers to a specific software under consideration,
which in this case is of FermiLab's Budget and Planning (BPS) System.
It has been validated using SPARQL.
