# ReqSpecOnto
Software Requirements Specification Ontology was developed by Usman Ahmed (usman.ahmed@fui.edu.pk) under the guidance of Dr. Khuram Shahzad (syed.khuram@umt.edu.pk) for the purpose of research in web semantics & software requirements specification. This Ontology was an effort to create unambiguous software requirements specification. Upper Ontology (classes, sub-classes, object properties and data properties, etc) part is the generic ontology for requirements specification of any software system while Derived Ontology (individuals) part in this ontology refers to a specific software under consideration, which in this case is of FermiLab's Budget and Planning (BPS) System. FermiLab is National Accelerator Lab managed by Fermi Researh Allience, LLC for U.S. Department of Energy. It has been validated using HermiT Reasoner and SPARQL queries.

Project contains two files namely, ReqSpecOnto.owl & ReqSpecOnto-Fermi.owl

    ReqSpecOnto.owl is the Upper generic Ontology which can be applied in other software scenarios while,
    ReqSpecOnto-Fermi.owl is the use case of FermiLab applied with individuals on upper ontology as an example of usage.
